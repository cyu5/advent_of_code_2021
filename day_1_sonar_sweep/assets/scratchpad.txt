 ---part 1--- 
  problem statement:
    Given an input file containing a list of positive integers, return how many numbers are larger than the previous number.

  example:
    1 2 3 3 1 2 4
    ->+ + _ - + +

  input:
    a file containing a list of positive integers
  output:
    [integer] num of increases

  algorithm:
    stream input file line by line,
    convert a stream of integers to Boolean of increased or not increased
    sum all the trues in the Boolean stream
    return the sum

---part 2---
  problem followup from part 1:
    Instead of looking at increases of the input, we transform input into a list of the sum of three consecutive numbers, then compute the sum of increases

  example:
    1 2 3 3 1 2 4
    ->  6 8 7 6 7
    ->    + - - +
    ->          2
